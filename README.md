# 👋 Hi, I'm 1Byte

I'm currently learning programming by building real-world tools — especially in game hacking and automation.  
This GitHub is where I document my progress, ideas, and projects related to:

- 🎯 Game cheats and memory manipulation
- 🛡️ Bypass and anti-detection tools
- ⚙️ Quality-of-life enhancements for gaming
- 🧠 Reverse engineering and tool development

| Project       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **SynthPadder** | Expands file size to evade anti-cheat size checks |
| **SynthAssist** | InDev |

## 🧠 My Goal

I simply enjoy learning new things and solving problems through code.  
My dream is to work in programming — not just to build cool things,  
but to make someone's life easier through what I create.

This GitHub is part of my journey to explore, experiment, and grow as a developer.
