# 👋 Hi, I'm 1Byte

I'm currently learning programming by building real-world tools — especially in game hacking and automation.  
This GitHub is where I document my progress, ideas, and projects related to:

- 🎯 Game cheats and memory manipulation (e.g. `SynthLoad`)
- 🛡️ Bypass and anti-detection tools (e.g. `SynthPadder`, `SynthGuard`)
- ⚙️ Quality-of-life enhancements for gaming
- 🧠 Reverse engineering and tool development

## 🚧 What I'm working on

| Project       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **SynthPadder** | Expands file size to evade anti-cheat size checks |

## 🧠 My Goal

To become really good at building low-level tools and understanding how games and protection systems work.  
This repo shows my learning journey — not everything is perfect, but everything is real. 😎
